# UML-Editor

This is a project for an object-oriented programming course. It mainly uses Java Swing to implement a UML editor that can create objects, association lines, and group, ungroup opjects. This project is designed to train students in the planning and implementation of object-oriented programming and to understand the importance of object-oriented programming in terms of program reuse, maintenance of future functionality, and expansion. It it is not well designed yet, hope it can be complete within a few weeks.
